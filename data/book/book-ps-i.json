Stoic and enduring, the people of Stensia huddle in their stone-crafted villages\u2014Shadowgrange, Krezk, Lammas\u2014built against the mountainsides. Wisps of thick fog twine amid the trunks of black pines in the Somberwald, thick bogs suck dead trees slowly down into their murky depths, and dusky pastureland provides scant sustenance to flocks of scrawny sheep.",

His bloodline is small and mostly irrelevant to the larger world, but in the outland valleys of Stensia, he is the ultimate master. Avacyn and Sigarda offer scant hope to his grim subjects. Abandoned by their angels and hunted by vampires, all the Stensians can do is endure the unending dusk.",

This document is designed to help you turn the book's adventure hooks and story seeds into a resource for your campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules.",

Even the traditional allies of humanity\u2014from angels and gryffs to herons and hounds\u2014are unreliable at best, as the madness that grips the angels seems to seep into every living thing. And at the same time, humanity's age-old enemies grow ever more dangerous.",
						"The specific horrors that the people of Innistrad fear most are all reflections of humanity's darker nature. Werewolves are a living embodiment of the secret rage and violence that hide in the human heart. Vampires are the bodily manifestation of carnal desire, hedonistic cravings, and bloodlust. Zombies and geists\u2014the restless spirits of the dead\u2014paint the eventual future of all people in the starkest terms, underlining the grim truths of human mortality. Demons are the unholy inversion of humanity's spiritual longings\u2014the shadow side of the angels' brightness.",
						"Still, the most dreadful creatures of Innistrad lurk within human towns and cities, pursuing their twisted schemes and unholy desires in the heart of civilization. These are the humans that have been consumed by Innistrad's darkness. Sinister cultists give themselves over to demons and other dark forces. Depraved necromancers raise the dead to do their bidding. Obsessive scholars pry into secrets best left hidden. Crazed scientists toy with forces of life and death in their effort to create artificial life or harness the energy that remains in the spirits of the dead. And even among the common folk\u2014on Innistrad as on every plane\u2014some simply give in to selfish desires and violent rage, killing with knife and garrote rather than sorcery."

The priests of the church perform ritual blessings on the faithful and their homes to ward off evil, and the church's soldiers and inquisitors have long hunted vampires and werewolves that prey on the people in their charge.",

Without warning, the searing fury of the archangel\u2014usually reserved for the greatest foes of humanity\u2014was turned on villages full of seemingly innocent people. Angels under Avacyn's leadership impaled the innocent on their spears and scoured the earth with celestial fire. Convinced that the sins of humanity had brought down Avacyn's wrath, the church took up the archangel's cause and sought to purge all sin through inquisition and execution.",

Here and there, renegade cathars disobeyed the mandate of the church and continued to hunt vampires and werewolves instead of punishing the innocent. But increasingly, the common folk\u2014farmers with their pitchforks, smiths with their hammers, and retired soldiers taking battle-worn swords down from above the mantle\u2014discovered new reserves of strength and resiliency to stand against the horrors of the darkness, even when those horrors were parish priests and holy knights."

						"{@class Sorcerer||Sorcerers} are rare. A spearsage (one of the archmages of Goldnight) could be a sorcerer, especially if you use the favored soul variant presented in Unearthed {@skill Arcana}. A sorcerer might also be a necro-alchemist or a cultist of some sort.",
						"{@class Warlock||Warlocks} are found primarily in cults of madness (with a Great Old One as patron), demon cults such as the Skirsdag, or witches' covens. A warlock who belongs to the Skirsdag might be a respected member of the church hierarchy, feigning the blessings of Avacynian clergy.",

Some feel called to minister to those isolated people living beyond the reach of a parish priest, but others take up the life of a monk because they disagree with their superiors in the hierarchy.

After his father's death, Strefan studied magic and forged a pact with the demon Shilgengar in return for the promise of immortality. After murdering his brother Sergei and drinking his blood, Strefan journeyed to Markov Manor and consulted with Edgar Markov. Together, they worked with Shilgengar to create the twelve bloodlines of vampires on Innistrad. Maurer Estate (Castle Ravenloft) was not spirited away to a demiplane\u2014it was already on Innistrad, itself a place of nightmares. And Strefan is not trapped here, so he is not seeking a successor in hopes of escaping. Newcomers to his domain do attract his attention, though, as the possibility of meeting a new consort is always on Strefan's mind.",
