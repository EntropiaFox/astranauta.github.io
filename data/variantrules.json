Together these elements help paint a picture of your character's origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a D&D race that has the Ability Score Increase trait includes little or no choice\u2014a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character's race if it includes the Ability Score Increase trait, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character. Character race in the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.",

						"The Ability Score Increase trait in a race reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the archetype.",
						"If you'd like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can't apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can't increase a score above 20.",

That same character could make a {@item +1 weapon} (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.",

If you're fighting in an ancient tomb the list could be Pile of Gold Coins, Scattered Bones, Rotting Tapestry, Moss-Covered Statue. Each turn, a player can work one of these elements into their description of their action. The primary purpose of this is to give players ideas; interesting details to use while describing their actions. But if a player comes up with a particularly clever way to use an element, the DM could grant advantage on a check or attack roll, or some other benefit. The rogue needs to cross a room full of enemies and wants to swing on the chandelier? As the DM, I'd let them make a simple Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to avoid opportunity attacks, essentially getting a free {@action Disengage} action.",

The roles are meant to provide a sense of the types of ability checks useful to managing a ship. Of these, though, captain is the only role that must be filled for the ship to function. A ship needs a single person to issue orders and respond to threats, otherwise a ship risks chaos and confusion during a crisis.",

						"{@b Cook}. A ship's cook works with the limited ingredients aboard a ship to make meals. A skilled cook keeps the crew's morale in top shape, while a poor one drags down the entire crew's performance.
