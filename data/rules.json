                "htmlcontent": "<h2>Beyond 1st Level</h2>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.\u00a0<br><br>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your Ability Scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character\u2019s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.<br><br>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).<br><br>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.<br><br>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level.

                "htmlcontent": "<h2>The Order of Combat</h2>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A <strong>round\u00a0</strong>represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.<br><br><h3>Combat Step by Step</h3><ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Determine surprise</strong>. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Establish positions</strong>: The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers\u2019 marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are\u2014how far away and in what direction.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Roll initiative</strong>: Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants\u2019 turns.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Take turns</strong>. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>\n<li><strong>Begin the next round</strong>. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>\n</ol><h4>Surprise</h4>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A Gelatinous Cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.<br><br>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn\u2019t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.<br><br>If you\u2019re surprised, you can\u2019t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can\u2019t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren\u2019t.<br><br><h4>Initiative</h4>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.<br><br>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.<br><br>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. <br><br>Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.<br><br><h4>Your Turn</h4>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your speed and <strong>take one action</strong>. <br><br>You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed\u2014sometimes called your walking speed\u2014is noted on your character sheet.<br>The most common actions you can take are described in the \u201cActions in Combat\u201d section. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.<br><br>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can\u2019t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \u201cActions in Combat.\u201d<br><br><h5>Bonus Actions</h5>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don\u2019t have a bonus action to take.<br>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.<br>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action\u2019s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.<br><br><h5>Other Activity on Your Turn</h5>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.<br><br>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.<br><br>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.<br><br>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.<br><br>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.<br><br><h4>Reactions</h4>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else\u2019s. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.<br>When you take a reaction, you can\u2019t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature\u2019s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.<br><br><h2>Movement and Position</h2>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.<br>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.<br>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you\u2019re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.<br><br><h3>Breaking Up Your Move</h3>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.<br><br><h4>Moving between Attacks</h4>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.<br><br><h4>Using Different Speeds</h4>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. <br><br>Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you\u2019ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can\u2019t use the new speed during the current move.<br><br>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the <em>fly</em> spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.<br><br><h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases\u2014the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.<br><br>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.<br><br>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.<br><br><h3>Being Prone</h3>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are Prone.<br><br>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.<br>For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can\u2019t stand up if you don\u2019t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.<br><br>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.<br><br><h4>Interacting with Objects Around You</h4>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:<br><br><ul>\n<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>\n<li>open or close a door</li>\n<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>\n<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>\n<li>take a bauble from a table</li>\n<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>\n<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>\n<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>\n<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>\n<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>\n<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>\n<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>\n<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>\n<li>extinguish a small flame</li>\n<li>don a mask</li>\n<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>\n<li>put your ear to a door</li>\n<li>kick a small stone</li>\n<li>turn a key in a lock</li>\n<li>tap the floor with a 10-\u00adfoot pole</li>\n<li>hand an item to another character</li>\n</ul><h3>Moving Around Other Creatures</h3>You can move through a nonhostile creature\u2019s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature\u2019s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature\u2019s space is difficult terrain for you.<br><br>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can\u2019t willingly end your move in its space.<br><br>If you leave a hostile creature\u2019s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.<br><br><h3>Flying Movement</h3>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the <em>fly</em> spell.<br><br><h3>Creature Size</h3>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. <strong>Table: Size Categories</strong> shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat.<br>Objects sometimes use the same size categories.<br><br>Space<br>A creature\u2019s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn\u2019t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can\u2019t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.<br><br>A creature\u2019s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there\u2019s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.<br><br>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there\u2019s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.<br><br><h4>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h4>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that\u2019s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it\u2019s in the smaller space.<br><br><h2>Actions in Combat</h2>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.<br><br>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.<br><br><h3>Attack</h3>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.<br>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \u201cMaking an Attack\u201d section for the rules that govern attacks.<br><br>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.<br><br><h3>Cast a Spell</h3>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.<br><br><h3>Dash</h3>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.<br>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.<br><br><h3>Disengage</h3>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn\u2019t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.<br><br><h3>Dodge</h3>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in Conditions) or if your speed drops to 0.<br><br><h3>Help</h3>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.<br><br>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally\u2019s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.<br><br><h3>Hide</h3>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \u201cUnseen Attackers and Targets\u201d section.<br><br><h3>Ready</h3>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.<br>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \u201cIf the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I\u2019ll pull the lever that opens it,\u201d and \u201cIf the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\u201d<br><br>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.<br><br>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell\u2019s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <em>web</em> spell and ready <em>magic missile</em>, your <em>web</em> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <em>magic missile</em> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.<br><br><h3>Search</h3>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.<br><br><h3>Use an Object</h3>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.<br><br><h2>Making an Attack</h2>Whether you\u2019re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.<br><br><ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Choose a target</strong>. Pick a target within your attack\u2019s range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Determine modifiers</strong>. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Resolve the attack</strong>. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li>\n</ol>If there\u2019s ever any question whether something you\u2019re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you\u2019re making an attack roll, you\u2019re making an attack.<br><br><h3>Attack Rolls</h3>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target\u2019s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.<br><br><h4>Modifiers to the Roll</h4>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character\u2019s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.<br><br><strong>Ability Modifier</strong>: The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.<br><br><strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong>: You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.<br><br><h4>Rolling 1 or 20</h4>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.<br><br>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target\u2019s AC. This is called a critical hit.<br><br>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target\u2019s AC.<br><br><h3>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h3>Combatants often try to escape their foes\u2019 notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.<br><br>When you attack a target that you can\u2019t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you\u2019re guessing the target\u2019s location or you\u2019re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn\u2019t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target\u2019s location correctly.<br><br>When a creature can\u2019t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden\u2014both unseen and unheard\u2014when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.<br><br><h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.<br><br><h4>Range</h4>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.<br>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can\u2019t attack a target beyond this range.<br><br>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can\u2019t attack a target beyond the long range.<br><br><h4>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h4>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn\u2019t incapacitated.<br><br><h3>Melee Attacks</h3>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.<br><br>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.<br><br>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.<br><br><h4>Opportunity Attacks</h4>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.<br>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.<br><br>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don\u2019t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don\u2019t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe\u2019s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.<br><br><h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you\u2019re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you\u2019re holding in the other hand. You don\u2019t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.<br><br>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.<br><br><h4>Grappling</h4>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you\u2019re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.<br><br>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target\u2019s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see Conditions ). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).<br><br><strong>Escaping a Grapple</strong>: A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.<br><br><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature</strong>: When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.<br><br><h3>Contests in Combat</h3>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.<br><br><h4>Shoving a Creature</h4>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you\u2019re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.<br>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target\u2019s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.<br><br><h2>Cover</h2>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.<br>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren\u2019t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.<br><br>A target with <strong>half cover</strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.<br><br>A target with <strong>three-quarters cover</strong> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.<br><br>A target with <strong>total cover</strong> can\u2019t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.<br><br><h2>Damage and Healing</h2>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a <em>fireball</em> spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.<br><br><h3>Hit Points</h3>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.<br><br>A creature\u2019s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature\u2019s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.<br><br>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature\u2019s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.<br><br><h3>Damage Rolls</h3>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.<br><br>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability modifier\u2014the same modifier used for the attack roll\u2014to the damage. A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.<br><br>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one target</strong> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts <em>fireball</em> or a cleric casts <em>flame strike</em>, the spell\u2019s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.<br><br><h4>Critical Hits</h4>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack\u2019s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack\u2019s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.<br><br>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue\u2019s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.<br><br><h4>Damage Types</h4>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.<br><br>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.<br><br><strong>Acid</strong>: The corrosive spray of a black dragon\u2019s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a Black Pudding deal acid damage.<br><br><strong>Bludgeoning</strong>: Blunt force attacks\u2014hammers, falling, constriction, and the like\u2014deal bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Cold</strong>: The infernal chill radiating from an Ice Devil\u2019s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon\u2019s breath deal cold damage.<br><br><strong>Fire</strong>: Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.<br><br><strong>Force</strong>: Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including <em>magic missile</em> and <em>spiritual weapon</em>.<br><br><strong>Lightning</strong>: A <em>lightning bolt</em> spell and a blue dragon\u2019s breath deal lightning damage.<br><br><strong>Necrotic</strong>: Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as <em>chill touch</em>, withers matter and even the soul.<br><br><strong>Piercing</strong>: Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters\u2019 bites, deal piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Poison</strong>: Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon\u2019s breath deal poison damage.<br><br><strong>Psychic</strong>: Mental abilities such as a mind flayer\u2019s psionic blast deal psychic damage.<br><br><strong>Radiant</strong>: Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric\u2019s <em>flame strike</em> spell or an angel\u2019s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.<br><br><strong>Slashing:</strong>\u00a0Swords, axes, and monsters\u2019 claws deal slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Thunder</strong>: A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the <em>thunderwave</em> spell, deals thunder damage.<br><br><h3>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h3>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.<br><br>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.<br><br>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.<br><br>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.<br><br><h3>Healing</h3>Unless it results in death, damage isn\u2019t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature\u2019s hit points, and magical methods such as a <em>cure wounds</em> spell or a <em>potion of healing</em> can remove damage in an instant.<br><br>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points can\u2019t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.<br><br>A creature that has died can\u2019t regain hit points until magic such as the <em>revivify</em> spell has restored it to life.<br><br><h3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.<br><br><h4>Instant Death</h4>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.<br>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.<br><br><h4>Falling Unconscious</h4>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see Conditions ). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.<br><br><h4>Death Saving Throws</h4>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn\u2019t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.<br><br><strong>Roll a d20</strong>: If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don\u2019t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.<br><br><strong>Rolling 1 or 20</strong>: When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.<br><br><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points</strong>: If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.<br><br><h4>Stabilizing a Creature</h4>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn\u2019t killed by a failed death saving throw.<br><br>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.<br><br>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn\u2019t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn\u2019t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.<br><br><h4>Monsters and Death</h4>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.<br><br>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.<br><br><h3>Knocking a Creature Out</h3>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.<br><br><h3>Temporary Hit Points</h3>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren\u2019t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.<br><br>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.<br><br>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.<br><br>Healing can\u2019t restore temporary hit points, and they can\u2019t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.<br><br>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn\u2019t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you\u2019re in that state, but only true healing can save you.<br>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they\u2019re depleted or you finish a long rest.<br><br><h2>Mounted Combat</h2>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.<br><br>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.<br><br><h3>Mounting and Dismounting</h3>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can\u2019t mount it if you don\u2019t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.<br><br>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you\u2019re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you\u2019re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.<br><br>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.<br><br><h3>Controlling a Mount</h3>While you\u2019re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.<br><br>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.<br><br>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.<br><br>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you\u2019re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.<br><br><h2>Underwater Combat</h2>When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.<br><br>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn\u2019t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.<br><br>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon\u2019s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).<br><br>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.<br>",

They need rest\u2014time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.<br><br>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.<br><br><h2>Short Rest</h2>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.<br><br>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character\u2019s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character\u2019s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character\u2019s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.<br><br><h2>Long Rest</h2>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours.

Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.<br><br>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.<br><br><h3>Lifestyle Expenses</h3>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.<br><br>Living a particular lifestyle doesn\u2019t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.<br><br><h3>Downtime Activities</h3>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.<br><br>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM. <a href=\"rules.html#Downtime\" target=\"_blank\">Additional downtime rules are featured in an April 2017 Unearthed Arcana, which include foils, buying magic items, carousing, crafting items, gambling, and more.</a><br><br><h4>Crafting</h4>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan\u2019s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith\u2019s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.<br><br>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.<br><br>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place.<br><br>Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.<br><br>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.<br><br><h4>Practicing a Profession</h4>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.<br><br>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves\u2019 guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.<br><br>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.<br><br><h4>Recuperating</h4>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.<br><br>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:<br><br><ul>\n<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Researching</h4>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign.<br><br>Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.<br><br>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone\u2019s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.<br><br>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.<br><br><h4>Training</h4>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.<br><br>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.<br><br>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.<br><br>A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. <strong>Mechanical traps</strong> include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. <strong>Magic traps</strong> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as <em>glyph of warding</em> and <em>symbol</em> that function as traps. <a href=\"rules.html#Traps (UA)\" target=\"_blank\">Additional rules for traps were featured in a February 2017 Unearthed Arcana.</a> <br><br><h2>Traps in Play</h2>When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.<br><br><h3>Triggering a Trap</h3>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap\u2019s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the <em>glyph of warding</em> spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.<br><br><h3>Detecting and Disabling a Trap</h3>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap\u2019s presence.<br><br>A trap\u2019s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap\u2019s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools to perform the necessary sabotage.<br><br>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap\u2019s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, <em>dispel magic</em> has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap\u2019s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.<br><br>In most cases, a trap\u2019s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character\u2019s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn\u2019t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap\u2019s description to determine what happens. No trap\u2019s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.<br><br>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap\u2019s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.<br><br>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it\u2019s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.<br><br>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.<br><br><h3>Trap Effects</h3>The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap\u2019s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.<br><br>The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap\u2019s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.<br><br>A trap intended to be a <strong>setback</strong> is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a <strong>dangerous</strong> trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A <strong>deadly</strong> trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Trap Danger</th>\n<th>Save DC</th>\n<th>Attack Bonus</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Setback</td>\n<td>10\u201311</td>\n<td>+3 to +5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dangerous</td>\n<td>12\u201315</td>\n<td>+6 to +8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadly</td>\n<td>16\u201320</td>\n<td>+9 to +12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><table>\n<caption>Damage Severity by Level</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Character Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Setback</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Dangerous</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Deadly</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st\u20134th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5th\u201310th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11th\u201316th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">17th\u201320th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">24d10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h3>Complex Traps</h3>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.<br><br>When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap\u2019s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.<br><br>For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap\u2019s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.<br><br><h2>Sample Traps</h2>The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.<br><br><h3>Collapsing Roof</h3><strong>Mechanical trap<br></strong><br>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.<br><br>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves\u2019 tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.<br><br>Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.<br><br>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it\u2019s in danger of collapse.<br><br>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.<br><br><h3>Falling Net</h3><strong>Mechanical trap<br></strong><br>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.<br><br>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves\u2019 tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.<br><br>When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.<br><br><h3>Fire-Breathing Statue</h3><strong>Magic trap<br></strong><br>This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.<br><br>The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as <em>detect magic</em>, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.<br><br>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.<br><br><h3>Pits</h3><strong>Mechanical trap</strong><br><br>Four basic pit traps are presented here:<br><br><strong>Simple Pit</strong>. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit\u2019s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris. The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit\u2019s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).<br><br><strong>Hidden Pit</strong>. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit\u2019s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.<br><br>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper. Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit\u2019s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the <em>arcane lock</em> spell or similar magic.<br><br><strong>Locking Pit</strong>. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.<br><br><strong>Spiked Pit</strong>. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><h3>Poison Darts</h3><strong>Mechanical trap<br></strong><br>When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.<br><br>The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.<br><br>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don\u2019t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><h3>Poison Needle</h3><strong>Mechanical trap<br></strong><br>A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest\u2019s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.<br>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.<br><br>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap\u2019s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\u2019 tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.<br><br><h3>Rolling Sphere</h3><strong>Mechanical trap<br></strong><br>When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap\u2019s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.<br><br>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate\u2019s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.<br><br>Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures\u2019 spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature\u2019s space or a creature enters its space while it\u2019s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.<br><br>The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can\u2019t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.<br><br>As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere\u2019s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere\u2019s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.<br><br><h3>Sphere of Annihilation</h3><strong>Magic trap<br></strong><br>Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.<br><br>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> that can\u2019t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal <em>sphere of annihilation</em>.<br><br>Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the <em>sympathy</em> aspect of the <em>antipathy/sympathy</em> spell. A successful <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 18) removes this enchantment.<br>",

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.<br><br>A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of <em>lesser restoration</em>. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.<br><br>A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren\u2019t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.<br><br><h2>Sample Diseases</h2>The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.<br><br><h3>Cackle Fever</h3>This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \u201cthe shrieks.\u201d<br>Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can\u2019t be removed until the disease is cured.<br><br>Any event that causes the infected creature great stress\u2014including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare\u2014forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.<br><br>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.<br><br>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6.<br><br>When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later.<br><br><h3>Sewer Plague</h3>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.<br><br>When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.<br><br>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague\u2019s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.<br><br>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character\u2019s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature\u2019s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.<br><br><h3>Sight Rot</h3>This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.<br><br>A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature\u2019s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a \u22121 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches \u22125, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as <em>lesser restoration</em> or <em>heal</em>.<br><br>Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.<br>",

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.<br><br><h2>Going Mad</h2>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as <em>contact other plane</em> and <em>symbol</em>, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.<br><br>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.<br><br><b>Lawful good</b><span> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.<br></span><br><b>Neutral good</b> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.<br><br><b>Chaotic good</b> (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.<br><br><b>Lawful neutral</b> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.<br><br><strong>Neutral</strong> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don\u2019t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.<br><br><strong>Chaotic neutral</strong> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.<br><br><strong>Lawful evil</strong> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.<br><br><strong>Neutral evil</strong> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.<br><br><strong>Chaotic evil</strong> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.<br><br><h4>Alignment in the Multiverse</h4>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.<br><br>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god\u2019s influence.)<br><br>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn\u2019t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.<br><br>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments\u2014they are <strong>unaligned</strong>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.<br><br>",

Your character\u2019s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.<br><br>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character\u2019s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is<em>what changed</em>? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don\u2019t you have <em>more</em> money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?<br><br>The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.<br><br><h4>Proficiencies</h4>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in \u201cUsing<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores\">Ability Scores</a>\u201d).<br><br>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in \u201c<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Equipment\">Equipment</a>\u201d).<br><br>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.<br><br><h4>Languages</h4>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See \u201cLanguages.\u201d<br><br><h4>Equipment</h4>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.<br><br><h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.<br><br><h4>Customizing a Background</h4>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can\u2019t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can\u2019t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world\u2019s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.<br><br><h2>The Celtic Pantheon</h2>It\u2019s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak\u2014and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.<br><br>The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.<br><br><h2>The Greek Pantheon</h2>The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they\u2019ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.<br><br><h2>The Egyptian Pantheon</h2>These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma\u2019at\u2014the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.<br><br>The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.<br><br><h2>The Norse Pantheon</h2>Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring\u2014this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It\u2019s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven\u2019t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it\u2019s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.<br><br>The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).<br><br><table>\n<caption>Celtic

A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.<br><br><strong>Ingested</strong>: A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.<br><br><strong>Inhaled</strong>: These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one\u2019s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.<br><br><strong>Injury</strong>: Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off.

On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn\u2019t poisoned.<br><br><strong>Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.<br><br><strong>Crawler Mucus (Contact)</strong>: This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br><strong>Drow Poison (Injury)</strong>: This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.<br><br><strong>Essence of Ether (Inhaled)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.<br><br><strong>Malice (Inhaled)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.<br><br><strong>Midnight Tears (Ingested)</strong>: A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><strong>Oil of Taggit (Contact)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.<br><br><strong>Pale Tincture (Ingested)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can\u2019t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.<br><br><strong>Purple Worm Poison (Injury)</strong>: This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated Purple Worm. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><strong>Serpent Venom (Injury)</strong>: This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated Giant Poisonous Snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><strong>Torpor (Ingested)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.<br><br><strong>Truth Serum (Ingested)</strong>: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can\u2019t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a Zone of Truth\u00a0spell.<br><br><strong>Wyvern Poison (Injury)</strong>: This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern.

Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities\u2014a creature\u2019s assets as well as weaknesses.<br><br>The three main rolls of the game\u2014the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll\u2014rely on the six ability scores. The book\u2019s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.<br><br><h2>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2>Each of a creature\u2019s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature\u2019s training and competence in activities related to that ability.<br><br>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.<br><br>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from \u22125 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.<br><br><table style=\"width: 250px\">\n<caption>Ability Scores and Modifiers</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Score</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Modifier</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u22125</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2\u20133</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u22124</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4\u20135</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u22123</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6\u20137</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u22122</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8\u20139</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u22121</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10\u201311</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12\u201313</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">14\u201315</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16\u201317</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18\u201319</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20\u201321</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">22\u201323</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">24\u201325</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">26\u201327</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">28\u201329</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).<br><br>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.<br><br><h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.<br><br>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don\u2019t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.<br><br>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.<br><br>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling\u2019s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.<br><br>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The<br>GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.<br><br><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.<br><br>Your proficiency bonus can\u2019t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.<br><br>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue\u2019s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.<br><br>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn\u2019t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don\u2019t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.<br><br>In general, you don\u2019t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.<br><br><h2>Ability Checks</h2>An ability check tests a character\u2019s or monster\u2019s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.<br><br>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.<br><br><table style=\"width: 250px\">\n<caption>Typical Difficulty Classes</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Task Difficulty</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">DC</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Very easy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Easy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very hard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nearly impossible</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success\u2014the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it\u2019s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.<br><br><h2>Contests</h2>Sometimes one character\u2019s or monster\u2019s efforts are directly opposed to another\u2019s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal\u2014for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.<br><br>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.<br><br>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.<br><br><h2>Skills</h2>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual\u2019s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character\u2019s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster\u2019s skill proficiencies appear in the monster\u2019s stat block.)<br><br>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character\u2019s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.<br><br>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability\u2019s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.<br><br>Strength<br><ul><li>Athletics</li></ul>Dexterity<br><ul>\n<li>Acrobatics</li>\n<li>Sleight of Hand</li>\n<li>Stealth</li>\n</ul>Intelligence<br><ul>\n<li>Arcana</li>\n<li>History</li>\n<li>Investigation</li>\n<li>Nature</li>\n<li>Religion</li>\n</ul>Wisdom<br><ul>\n<li>Animal Handling</li>\n<li>Insight</li>\n<li>Medicine</li>\n<li>Perception</li>\n<li>Survival</li>\n</ul>Charisma<br><ul>\n<li>Deception</li>\n<li>Intimidation</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Persuasion</li>\n</ul>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill\u2014for example, \u201cMake a Wisdom (Perception) check.\u201d At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.<br><br>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character\u2019s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.<br><br><h3>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h3>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you\u2019re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.<br><br><h3>Passive Checks</h3>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\u2019t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.<br><br>Here\u2019s how to determine a character\u2019s total for a passive check:<br>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check<br><br>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.<br><br>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.<br><br>The rules on hiding in the \u201cDexterity\u201d section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.<br><br><h3>Working Together</h3>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who\u2019s leading the effort\u2014or the one with the highest ability modifier\u2014can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.<br><br>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves\u2019 tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can\u2019t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.<br><br><h3>Group Checks</h3>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren\u2019t.<br><br>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.<br>Otherwise, the group fails.<br><br>Group checks don\u2019t come up very often, and they\u2019re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger.\u00a0Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.<br><br><h2>Using Each Ability</h2>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.<br><br><h3>Strength</h3>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.<br><br><h4>Strength Checks</h4>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.<br><br><strong>Athletics</strong>. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:<br><ul>\n<li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li>\n<li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li>\n<li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li>\n</ul><strong>Other Strength Checks</strong>. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>\n<li>Break free of bonds</li>\n<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>\n<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>\n<li>Tip over a statue</li>\n<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.<br><br><h4>Lifting and Carrying</h4>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.<br><br><strong>Carrying Capacity</strong>. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don\u2019t usually have to worry about it.<br><br><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift</strong>. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.<br><br><strong>Size and Strength</strong>. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature\u2019s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.<br><br><h4>Variant: Encumbrance</h4>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.<br><br>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.<br><br>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead\u00a0<strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.<br><br><h3>Dexterity</h3>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.<br><br><h4>Dexterity Checks</h4>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.<br><br><strong>Acrobatics</strong>. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you\u2019re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship\u2019s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.<br><br><strong>Sleight of Hand</strong>. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person\u2019s pocket.<br><br><strong>Stealth</strong>. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.<br><br><strong>Other Dexterity Checks</strong>. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>\n<li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>\n<li>Pick a lock</li>\n<li>Disable a trap</li>\n<li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>\n<li>Wriggle free of bonds</li>\n<li>Play a stringed instrument</li>\n<li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.<br><br><h4>Armor Class</h4>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.<br><br><h4>Initiative</h4>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures\u2019 turns in combat.<br><br><h4>Hiding</h4>The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check\u2019s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.<br><br>You can\u2019t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.<br>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.<br><br>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.<br><br><strong>Passive Perception</strong>. When you hide, there\u2019s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren\u2019t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature\u2019s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-\u00adlevel character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.<br><br><em><strong>What Can You See?</strong></em> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured</strong>, as explained in \u201cThe Environment.\u201d<br><br><h3>Constitution</h3>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.<br><br><h4>Constitution Checks</h4>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.<br><br>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Hold your breath</li>\n<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>\n<li>Go without sleep</li>\n<li>Survive without food or water</li>\n<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Hit Points</h4>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.<br><br>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you\u2019re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.<br><br><h3>Intelligence</h3>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.<br><br><h4>Intelligence Checks</h4>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.<br><br><strong>Arcana</strong>. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.<br><br><strong>History</strong>. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.<br><br><strong>Investigation</strong>. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.<br><br><strong>Nature</strong>. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.<br><br><strong>Religion</strong>. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.<br><br><strong>Other Intelligence Checks</strong>. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>\n<li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>\n<li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>\n<li>Forge a document</li>\n<li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>\n<li>Win a game of skill</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.<br><br><h3>Wisdom</h3>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.<br><br><h4>Wisdom Checks</h4>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone\u2019s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.<br><br><strong>Animal Handling</strong>. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal\u2019s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.<br><br><strong>Insight</strong>. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone\u2019s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.<br><br><strong>Medicine</strong>. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.<br><br><strong>Perception</strong>. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.<br><br><strong>Survival</strong>. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.<br><br><strong>Other Wisdom Checks</strong>. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.<br><br><h3>Charisma</h3>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.<br><br><h4>Charisma Checks</h4>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.<br><br><strong>Deception</strong>. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast- talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone\u2019s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.<br><br><strong>Intimidation</strong>. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.<br><br><strong>Performance</strong>. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.<br><br><strong>Persuasion</strong>. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.<br><br><strong>Other Charisma Checks</strong>. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>\n<li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>\n</ul><br><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.<br><br><h2>Saving Throws</h2>A saving throw\u2014also called a save\u2014represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don\u2019t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.<br><br>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.<br><br>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.<br><br>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.<br><br>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster\u2019s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.<br><br>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save.\u00a0Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope\u2014all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.<br><br>The GM can summarize the adventurers\u2019 movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \u201cYou travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\u201d Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \u201cAfter killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\u201d<br><br>Sometimes it\u2019s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they\u2019re moving over.<br><br><h3>Speed</h3>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.<br>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.<br><br><h4>Travel Pace</h4>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.<br><br><strong>Forced March</strong>. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.<br>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.<br>The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see Conditions ).<br><br><strong>Mounts and Vehicles</strong>. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.<br><br>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don\u2019t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.<br><br>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a <em>carpet of flying</em>, allow you to travel more swiftly.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Travel Pace and Effects</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Pace</th>\n<th colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Distance Traveled per...</th>\n<th rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Effect</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Minute</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Hour</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Day</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fast</td>\n<td>400 feet</td>\n<td>4 miles</td>\n<td>30 miles</td>\n<td>\u22125 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>300 feet</td>\n<td>3 miles</td>\n<td>24 miles</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow</td>\n<td>200 feet</td>\n<td>2 miles</td>\n<td>18 miles</td>\n<td>Able to use stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground\u2014all considered difficult terrain.<br><br>You move at half speed in difficult terrain\u2014moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed\u2014so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.<br><br><h3>Special Types of Movement</h3>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.<br><br><h4>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h4>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM\u2019s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.<br><br><h4>Jumping</h4>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.<br><br><strong>Long Jump</strong>. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.<br><br>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn\u2019t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM\u2019s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump\u2019s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.<br><br>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.<br><br><strong>High Jump</strong>. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.<br><br>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1\u00bd times your height.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).<br><br>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\u2019t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.<br><br>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\u2019s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\u2019s rest in a poor inn.<br><br>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.

Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.<br><br><strong>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment</strong><span>: As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.</span><br><strong><br>Magic Items</strong>: Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn\u2019t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won\u2019t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.<br><strong><br>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects</strong>: These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.<br><strong><br>Trade Goods</strong>: On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods\u2014bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on\u2014retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.<br><br>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.<br><br><strong>Armor Proficiency</strong>: Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor\u2019s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can\u2019t cast spells.<br><br><strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong>: Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.<br><br><strong>Heavy Armor</strong>: Heavier armor interferes with the wearer\u2019s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \u201cStr 13\u201d or \u201cStr 15\u201d in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer\u2019s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.<br><br><strong>Stealth</strong>: If the Armor table shows \u201cDisadvantage\u201d in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.<br><br><strong>Shields</strong>: A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.<br><br><a></a><a></a><h3>Light Armor</h3>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.<br><br><strong>Padded</strong>: Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.<br><br><strong>Leather</strong>: The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.<br><br><strong>Studded Leather</strong>: Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.<br><br><a></a><a></a><h3>Medium Armor</h3>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.<br><br><strong>Hide</strong>: This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.<br><br><strong>Chain Shirt</strong>: Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer\u2019s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.<br><br><strong>Scale Mail</strong>: This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.<br><br><strong>Breastplate</strong>: This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer\u2019s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.<br><br><strong>Half Plate</strong>: Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer\u2019s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.<br><br><a></a><a></a><h3>Heavy Armor</h3>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.<br><br>Heavy armor doesn\u2019t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn\u2019t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.<br><br><strong>Ring Mail</strong>: This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it\u2019s usually worn only by those who can\u2019t afford better armor.<br><br><strong>Chain Mail</strong>: Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.<br><br><strong>Splint</strong>: This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.<br><br><strong>Plate</strong>: Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Armor</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Armor</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Cost</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Armor Class (AC)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Strength</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Stealth</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Weight</th>\n</tr>\n<tr><td colspan=\"6\">Light Armor</td></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Padded</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Leather</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Studded leather</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">45 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<thead><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Medium Armor</td></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Hide</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Chain shirt</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Scale mail</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">45 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Breastplate</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">400 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Half plate</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">750 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">40 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<thead><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Heavy Armor</td></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Ring mail</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">40 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Chain mail</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">75 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Str 13</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">55 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Splint</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">200 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Str 15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">60 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Plate</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,500 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Str 15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Disadvantage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">65 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<thead><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Shield</td></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left:10px\">Shield</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6 lb.</td>\n</tr></tbody>\n</table><br><br><a></a><a></a><h3>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h3>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor\u2019s category.<br><br><strong>Don</strong>: This is the time it takes to put on armor.

                "htmlcontent": "Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class\u2019s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.<br><br>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.<br><br><h3>Weapon Proficiency</h3>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.<br><br>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.<br><br><h3>Weapon Properties</h3>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.<br><br><h4>Ammunition</h4>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \u201cImprovised Weapons\u201d later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.<br><br><h4>Finesse</h4>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.<br><br><h4>Heavy</h4><strong></strong>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon\u2019s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.<br><br><h4>Light</h4>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.<br><br><h4>Loading</h4>Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.<br><br><h4>Range</h4>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon\u2019s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon\u2019s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can\u2019t attack a target beyond the weapon\u2019s long range.<br><br><h4>Reach</h4>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.<br><br><h4>Special</h4>A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon\u2019s description (see \u201cSpecial Weapons\u201d later in this section).<br><br><h4>Thrown</h4>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.<br><br><h4>Two-Handed</h4>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it, but not when you simply hold it.<br><br><h4>Versatile</h4>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property\u2014the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.<br><br><h4>Improvised Weapons</h4>Sometimes characters don\u2019t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.<br><br>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM\u2019s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.<br><br>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.<br><br><h4>Silvered Weapons</h4>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.<br><br><h4>Special Weapons</h4>Weapons with special rules are described here.<br><br><strong>Lance</strong>: You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren\u2019t mounted.<br><br><strong>Net</strong>: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Weapons</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Weapon</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<th>Properties</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<thead><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Simple

                "htmlcontent": "This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.<br><strong><br>Acid</strong>: As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.<br><strong><br>Alchemist\u2019s Fire</strong>: This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist\u2019s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.<br><strong><br>Antitoxin</strong>: A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.<br><strong><br>Arcane Focus</strong>: An arcane focus is a special item\u2014an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item\u2014designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.<br><strong><br>Ball Bearings</strong>: As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn\u2019t need to make the save.<br><strong><br>Block and Tackle</strong>: A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.<br><strong><br>Book</strong>: A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).<br><strong><br>Caltrops</strong>: As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature\u2019s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn\u2019t need to make the save.<br><strong><br>Candle</strong>: For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.<br><strong><br>Case, Crossbow Bolt</strong>: This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.<br><strong><br>Case, Map or Scroll</strong>: This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.<br><strong><br>Chain</strong>: A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br><strong><br>Climber\u2019s Kit</strong>: A climber\u2019s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber\u2019s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can\u2019t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can\u2019t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.<br><strong><br>Component Pouch</strong>: A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell\u2019s description).<br><strong><br>Crowbar</strong>: Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar\u2019s leverage can be applied.<br><strong><br>Druidic Focus</strong>: A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.<br><strong><br>Fishing Tackle</strong>: This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.<br><strong><br>Healer\u2019s Kit</strong>: This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.<br><strong><br>Holy Symbol</strong>: A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Pantheons lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.<br><strong><br>Holy Water</strong>: As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.<br><strong><br>Hunting Trap</strong>: When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.<br><strong><br>Lamp</strong>: A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.<br><strong><br>Lantern, Bullseye</strong>: A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.<br><strong><br>Lantern, Hooded</strong>: A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.<br><strong><br>Lock</strong>: A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u2019 tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.<br><strong><br>Magnifying Glass</strong>: This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.<br><strong><br>Manacles</strong>: These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u2019 tools can pick the manacles\u2019 lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.<br><strong><br>Mess Kit</strong>: This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.<br><strong><br>Oil</strong>: Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.<br><strong><br>Poison, Basic</strong>: You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.<br><strong><br>Potion of Healing</strong>: A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.<br><strong><br>Pouch</strong>: A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).<br><strong><br>Quiver</strong>: A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.<br><strong><br>Ram, Portable</strong>: You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.<br><strong><br>Rations</strong>: Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.<br><strong><br>Rope</strong>: Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.<br><strong><br>Scale, Merchant\u2019s</strong>: A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.<br><strong><br>Spellbook</strong>: Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.<br><strong><br>Spyglass</strong>: Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.<br><strong><br>Tent</strong>: A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.<br><strong><br>Tinderbox</strong>: This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch\u2014or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel\u2014takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.<br><strong><br>Torch</strong>: A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Adventuring Gear</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th

These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).

Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.<br><strong>Saddles</strong>: A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.<br><br><strong>Vehicle Proficiency</strong>: If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.<br><br><strong>Rowed Vessels</strong>: Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers.

The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Trade Goods</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Goods</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 cp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of wheat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 cp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of flour or one chicken</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 cp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of salt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 sp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of iron or 1 sq. yd. of canvas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 sp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of copper or 1 sq. yd. of cotton cloth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of ginger or one goat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of cinnamon or pepper, or one sheep</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of cloves or one pig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of silver or 1 sq. yd. of linen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>1 sq. yd. of silk or one cow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of saffron or one ox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500 gp</td>\n<td>1 lb. of platinum</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>",

                "htmlcontent": "<p>Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost \nvaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner\u2019s capabilities in wondrous ways.</p>\n<h2>Attunement</h2>\n<p>Some magic items require a creature to form a bond  with them before their magical properties can be  used. This bond is called attunement, and certain  items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is  a class, a creature must be a member of that class to  attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class,  a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that  class\u2019s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a  spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least  one spell using its traits or features, not using a  magic item or the like.</p>\n<p> Without becoming attuned to an item that  requires attunement, a creature gains only its  nonmagical benefits, unless its description states  otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires  attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield  to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical  properties. </p>\n<p>Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a  short rest focused on only that item while being in  physical contact with it (this can\u2019t be the same short  rest used to learn the item\u2019s properties). This focus  can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon),  meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other  appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted,  the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end  of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive  understanding of how to activate any magical  properties of the item, including any necessary  command words. </p>\n<p>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a  time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than  three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to  a fourth item fails; the creature must end its  attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature  can\u2019t attune to more than one copy of an item. For  example, a creature can\u2019t attune to more than one  ring of protection at a time. </p>\n<p> A creature\u2019s attunement to an item ends if the  creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for  attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet  away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if  another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending  another short rest focused on the item, unless the  item is cursed.</p>\n<h2>Wearing and Wielding Items</h2>\n<p>Using a magic item\u2019s properties might mean wearing  or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must  be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the  feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the  head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be  donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak  fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be  held. </p>\n<p>In most cases, a magic item that\u2019s meant to be  worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.  Many magic garments are made to be easily  adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to  the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story  suggests a good reason for an item to fit only  creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that  it doesn\u2019t adjust. For example, drow-made armor  might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items  usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.</p>\n<p>When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use  your discretion as to whether the item functions as  intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but  a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can\u2019t  wear boots. </p>\n<h3>Multiple Items of the Same Kind</h3>\n<p>Use common sense to determine whether more than  one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A  character can\u2019t normally wear more than one pair of  footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of  bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,  and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character  might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for  example, or to layer two cloaks. </p>\n<h3>Paired Items</h3>\n<p>Items that come in pairs\u2014such as boots, bracers,  gauntlets, and gloves\u2014impart their benefits only if  both items of the pair are worn. For example, a  character wearing a boot of striding and springing  on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot  gains no benefit from either. </p>\n<h2>Activating an Item</h2>\n<p>Activating some magic items requires a user to do  something special, such as holding the item and  uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item  is activated. Certain items use the following rules for  their activation. </p>\n<p>If an item requires an action to activate, that  action isn\u2019t a function of the Use an Item action, so a  feature such as the rogue\u2019s Fast Hands can\u2019t be used  to activate the item. \n</p>\n<h3>Command Word</h3>\n<p>A command word is a word or phrase that must be  spoken for an item to work. A magic item that  requires a command word can\u2019t be activated in an  area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the  silence spell. </p>\n<h3>Consumables</h3>\n<p>Some items are used up when they are activated. A  potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil  applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a  scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item  loses its magic.</p>\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n<p>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from  the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell  level, doesn\u2019t expend any of the user\u2019s spell slots, and  requires no components, unless the item\u2019s  description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal  casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the  item must concentrate if the spell requires  concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass  the casting of a spell and confer the spell\u2019s effects,  with their usual duration. Certain items make  exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time,  duration, or other parts of a spell.</p>\n<p> magic item, such as certain staffs, may require  you to use your own spellcasting ability when you  cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one  spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use  with the item. If you don\u2019t have a spellcasting  ability\u2014perhaps you\u2019re a rogue with the Use Magic  Device feature\u2014your spellcasting ability modifier is  +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does  apply. </p>\n<h3>Charges</h3>\n<p>Some magic items have charges that must be  expended to activate their properties. The number of  charges an item has remaining is revealed when an  identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature  attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many  charges it regained. </p>",

                "htmlcontent": "Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.<br><br>Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.<br><br>Sentient Magic Items function as NPCs under the GM\u2019s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item\u2019s control, not its wielder\u2019s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.<br><br><h2>Creating Sentient Magic Items</h2>When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item\u2019s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.<br><br><h3>Abilities</h3>A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item\u2019s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.<br><br><h3>Communication</h3>A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.<br><br><table>\n<thead><tr>\n<td>d100</td>\n<td>Communication</td>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01 - 60</td>\n<td>The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creating carrying or wielding it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61 - 90</td>\n<td>The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91 - 00</td>\n<td>The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h3>Senses</h3>With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.<br><br><table>\n<thead><tr>\n<td>d4</td>\n<td>Senses</td>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Hearing and normal vision to 30 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Hearing and normal vision to 60 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Hearing and normal vision to 120 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Hearing and darkvision to 120 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><h3>Alignment</h3>A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.<br><br><table>\n<thead><tr>\n<td>d100</td>\n<td>Alignment</td>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01 - 15</td>\n<td>Lawful Good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16 - 35</td>\n<td>Neutral Good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36 - 50</td>\n<td>Chaotic Good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51 - 63</td>\n<td>Lawful Neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>64 - 73</td>\n<td>Neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74 - 85</td>\n<td>Chaotic Neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>86 - 89</td>\n<td>Lawful Evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90 - 96</td>\n<td>Neutral Evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>97 - 00</td>\n<td>Chaotic Evil</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h3>Special Purpose</h3>You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder\u2019s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.<br><table>\n<thead><tr>\n<td>d10</td>\n<td>Purpose</td>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\n<em>Aligned:</em>\u00a0The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment (such an item is never neutral).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\n<em>Bane:</em>\u00a0The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or Wizards.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>\n<em>Protector:</em>\u00a0The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as Elves or Druids.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>\n<em>Crusader:</em>\u00a0The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>\n<em>Destroyer:\u00a0</em> The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>\n<em>Glory Seeker: </em>The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>\n<em>Lore Seeker: </em>The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>\n<em>Destiny Seeker:</em>\u00a0The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>\n<em>Creator Seeker:</em>\u00a0The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h2>Conflict</h2>A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item\u2019s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder\u2019s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:<br><br><ul>\n<li>The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.</li>\n<li>The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.</li>\n<li>The item demands that its wielder pursue the item\u2019s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.</li>\n<li>The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses to comply with the item\u2019s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:<br><ul>\n<li>Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li>\n<li>Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li>\n<li>Attempt to take control of its wielder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma Saving Throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item\u2019s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item\u2019s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can\u2019t use this power again until the next dawn.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire\u2019s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character\u2019s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.<br><br>For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.<br><br><h2>Statistics for Objects</h2>When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.<br><br><strong>Armor Class</strong>: An object\u2019s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). Table: Object Armor Class provides suggested AC values for various substances.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Object Armor Class</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Substance</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">AC</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloth, paper, rope</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crystal, glass, ice</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wood, bone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Iron, steel</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mithral</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adamantine</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">23</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><strong>Hit Points</strong>: An object\u2019s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. Table: Object Hit Points provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Object Hit Points</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Fragile</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Resilient</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2 (1d4)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5 (2d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small (chest, lute)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3 (1d6)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 (3d6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4 (1d8)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18 (4d8)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large (cart, 10-\u00adft.-\u00adby-\u00ad10-\u00adft. window)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5 (1d10)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">27 (5d10)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><strong>Huge and Gargantuan Objects</strong>: Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an <em>earthquake</em> spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object\u2019s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section\u2019s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.<br><br><strong>Objects and Damage Types</strong>: Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone yet can\u2019t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.<br><br><strong>Damage Threshold</strong>: Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object\u2019s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn\u2019t reduce the object\u2019s hit points.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the <strong>planes of existence</strong>. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane.<br><br>Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.<br><br>Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.<br><br><h2>The Material Plane</h2>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.<br><br>The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.<br><br><h2>Beyond the Material</h2>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They\u2019re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.<br><br><h3>Planar Travel</h3>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.<br><br>Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.<br><br><strong>Spells</strong>: A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <em>Plane shift</em> and <em>gate</em> can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. <em>Etherealness</em> allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches\u2014such as the Elemental Planes. And the\u00a0<em>astral projection</em> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.<br><br><strong>Portals</strong>: A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations\u2014circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns\u2014that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).<br><br><h3>Transitive Planes</h3>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as<em>etherealness</em> and <em>astral projection</em> allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.<br><br>The <strong>Ethereal Plane</strong> is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the <em>See Invisibility </em>and <em>true seeing</em> spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as <em>forcecage</em> and <em>wall of force</em>. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.<br><br>The <strong>Astral Plane</strong> is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.<br><br><h3>Inner Planes</h3>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four <strong>Elemental Planes</strong>\u2014Air, Earth, Fire, and Water\u2014form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning <strong>Elemental Chaos</strong>.<br><br>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form\u2014great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.<br><h3>Outer Planes</h3>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.<br><br>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \u201cplaces\u201d at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.<br><br>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.<br><br>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day\u2014if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.<br><br>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Outer Planes</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Outer Plane</th>\n<th>Alignment</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of</td>\n<td>LG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bytopia, the Twin Paradises of</td>\n<td>NG, LG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elysium, the Blessed Fields of</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Beastlands, the Wilderness of</td>\n<td>NG, CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arborea, the Olympian Glades of</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ysgard, the Heroic Domains of</td>\n<td>CN, CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Limbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of</td>\n<td>CN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pandemonium, the Windswept Depths of</td>\n<td>CN, CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Abyss, the Infinite Layers of</td>\n<td>CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carceri, the Tarterian Depths of</td>\n<td>NE, CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hades, the Grey Waste of</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gehenna, the Bleak Eternity of</td>\n<td>NE, LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Nine Hells (of Baator)</td>\n<td>LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield of</td>\n<td>LN, LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of</td>\n<td>LN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of</td>\n<td>LN, LG</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the <strong>Upper Planes</strong>. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the <strong>Lower Planes</strong>. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane\u2019s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn\u2019t match the plane\u2019s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.<br><br><h4>Demiplanes</h4>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don\u2019t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as <em>demiplane</em>, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a\u00a0<em>plane shift</em> spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The <em>gate</em> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.<br><br><h1>Falling</h1>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.<br><br><h1>Suffocating</h1>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).<br><br>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can\u2019t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.<br><br>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.<br><br><h1>Vision and Light</h1>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring\u2014noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few\u2014rely heavily on a character\u2019s ability to see.<br><br>Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.<br>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br>A <strong>heavily obscured</strong> area\u2014such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage\u2014blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see Conditions ) when trying to see something in that area.<br><br>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.<br><br><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.<br><br><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.<br><br><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.<br><br><h2>Blindsight</h2>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.<br><br><h2>Darkvision</h2>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision.\u00a0Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br><br><h2>Truesight</h2>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.\u00a0Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.<br><br><h1>Food and Water</h1>Characters who don\u2019t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see Conditions ). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can\u2019t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.<br><br><h4>Food</h4>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.<br><br>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.<br><br>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.<br><br><h4>Water</h4>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.<br><br>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.<br><br><h1>Interacting with Objects</h1>A character\u2019s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.<br><br>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.<br><br>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object\u2019s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It\u2019s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.<br><br>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "The play of the <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> game unfolds according to this basic pattern.<br><br><strong>1. The DM describes the environment.</strong> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what\u2019s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what\u2019s on a table, who\u2019s in the tavern, and so on).<br><br><strong>2. The players describe what they want to do.</strong> Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \u0022We\u2019ll take the east door,\u0022 for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don\u2019t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.<br><br>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.<br><br><strong>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers\u2019 actions.</strong> Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.<br><br>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.<br><br>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM\u2019s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood. and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.<br><br><h2>Game Dice</h2>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.<br><br>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).<br><br>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example. the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.<br><br>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add, For example, \u00223d8+5\u0022 means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.<br><br>The same d notation appears in the expressions \u00221d3\u0022 and \u00221d2.\u0022 To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it\u2019s a 2).<br><br><h2>The d20</h2>Does an adventurer\u2019s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.<br><br>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six <strong>ability scores</strong>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the <strong>ability modifiers</strong> derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character\u2019s or monster\u2019s behalf.<br><br>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.<br><br><strong>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</strong> Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character\u2019s particular skill. <br><br><strong>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</strong> A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.<br><br><strong>3. Compare the total to a target number.</strong> If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it\u2019s a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <strong>Difficulty Class</strong> (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an <strong>Armor Class</strong> (AC). This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play.<br><br><h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.<br><br><h2>Specific Beats General</h2>This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.<br><br>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don\u2019t have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can\u2019t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.<br><br><h2>Round Down</h2>There\u2019s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction. even if the fraction is one-half or greater.",

                "htmlcontent": "Your first step in playing an adventurer in a Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics. roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world.<br><br>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. If you don\u2019t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches your interest.<br><br>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What\u2019s important is that you come to the table with a character you\u2019re excited to play. Throughout this section, we use the term <strong>character sheet<\/strong> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it\u2019s a formal character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.<br><br><h4>Building Bruenor<\/h4>Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor. <h2>1. Choose a Race<\/h2>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.<br><br>The race you choose contributes to your character\u2019s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character\u2019s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.<br><br>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later. Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well. <br><br><h4>Building Bruenor, Step 1<\/h4>Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish. <h2>2. Choose a Class<\/h2>Every adventurer is a member of a class, Class broadly describes a character\u2019s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.<br><br>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are <strong>class features<\/strong>\u2014capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of <strong>proficiencies<\/strong>: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.<br><br>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level. <br><br><h4>Level<\/h4>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining <strong>experience points<\/strong> (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before. Starting off at 1st level marks your character\u2019s entry into the adventuring life. If you\u2019re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.<br><br>Record your level on your character sheet. if you\u2019re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level. <br><br><h4>Hit Points and Hit Dice<\/h4>Your character\u2019s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).<br><br> <table> <caption>Ability Score Summary<\/caption> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Strength<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr><td><em>Measures<\/em>: Natural athleticism, bodily power<br><em>Important for<\/em>: Barbarian, fighter, paladin<br><em>Racial Increases<\/em>: Mountain dwarf (+2), Half-orc (+2), Dragonborn (+2), Human (+1)<br><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dexterity<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><em>Measures<\/em>: Physical agility, reflexes, balance, poise<br><em>Important for<\/em>: Monk, ranger, rogue<br><em>Racial Increases<\/em>: Elf (+2), Forest gnome (+1), Halfling (+2), Human (+1)<br><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><strong>Constitution<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><em>Measures<\/em>: Health, stamina, vital force<br> <em>Important for<\/em>: Everyone<br> <em>Racial Increases<\/em>: Dwarf (+2), Half-orc (+1),  Stout halfling (+1),  Human (+1),  Rock gnome (+1)<br><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><strong>Intelligence<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><em>Measures<\/em>: Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill<br> <em>Important for<\/em>: Wizard<br> <em>Racial Increases<\/em>: High elf (+1), Tiefling (+1),  Gnome (+2),  Human (+1)<br><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><strong>Wisdom<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><em>Measures<\/em>: Awareness, intuition, insight<br> <em>Important for<\/em>: Cleric, druid<br> <em>Racial Increases<\/em>: Hill dwarf (+1),  Human (+1),  Wood elf (+1)<br><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td><strong>Charisma<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr><tr> <td><em>Measures<\/em>: Confidence, eloquence, leadership<br> <em>Important far<\/em>: Bard, sorcerer, warlock<br> <em>Racial increase<\/em>: Half-elf (+2),  Dragonborn (+1),  Drow (+1),  Human (+1),  Lightfoot halfling (+1), Tiefling (+2)<br><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody> <\/table><br><br>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you\u2019ll determine in step 3.) This is also your <strong>hit point maximum<\/strong>.<br><br>Record your character\u2019s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points. <br><br><h4>Proficiency Bonus<\/h4>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you\u2019ll be recording on your character sheet:<br> <ul> <li> Attack rolls using weapons you\u2019re proficient with<\/li> <li>Attack rolls with spells you cast<\/li> <li>Ability checks using skills you\u2019re proficient in<\/li> <li>Ability checks using tools you\u2019re proficient with<\/li> <li>Saving throws you\u2019re proficient in<\/li> <li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spcllcasting class)<\/li> <\/ul><br>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.<br><br>Your proficiency bonus can\u2019t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it, if a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once. <br><br><h4>Building Bruenor, Step 2<\/h4>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter\u2019s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.<br><br>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die\u2014a d10\u2014and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor\u2019s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is 4-2.<br><br> <h2>3. Determine Ability Scores<\/h2>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <strong>Strength<\/strong>, <strong>Dexterity<\/strong>, <strong>Constitution<\/strong>, <strong>Intelligence<\/strong>, <strong>Wisdom<\/strong>, and <strong>Charisma<\/strong>. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.<br><br>The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.<br><br>You generate your character\u2019s six <strong>ability scores<\/strong> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don\u2019t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10.8.<br><br>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character\u2019s six abilities to assign scores to Strength. Dexterity. Constitution, Intelligence. Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice. After assigning your ability scores, determine your <strong>ability modifiers<\/strong>using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores. <br><br><h4>Building Bruenor, Step 3<\/h4>Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor\u2019s abilities. Since he\u2019s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His nexthighest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor\u2019s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor\u2019s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).<br><br>Bob fills in Bruenor\u2019s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, fora total of 13 hit points. <br><br><h4>Variant: Customizing Ability Scores<\/h4>At your Dungeon Master\u2019s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.<br><br>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can\u2019t have a score lower than 8.<br><br>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.<br><br> <table style=\"width: 250px;\"> <caption>Ability Score Point Cost<\/caption> <thead> <tr> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">Score<\/th> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">Cost<\/th> <\/tr> <\/thead> <tbody style=\"text-align: center;\"> <tr> <td>8<\/td> <td>0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>9<\/td> <td>1<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>10<\/td> <td>2<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>11<\/td> <td>3<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>12<\/td> <td>4<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>13<\/td> <td>5<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>14<\/td> <td>7<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>15<\/td> <td>9<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody> <\/table> <table style=\"width: 250px;\"> <caption>Ability Scores and Modifiers<\/caption> <thead> <tr> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">Score<\/th> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">Modifier<\/th> <\/tr> <\/thead> <tbody style=\"text-align: center;\"> <tr> <td>1<\/td> <td>-5<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>2-3<\/td> <td>-4<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>4-5<\/td> <td>-3<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>6-7<\/td> <td>-2<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>8-9<\/td> <td>-1<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>10-11<\/td> <td>+0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>12-13<\/td> <td>+1<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>14-15<\/td> <td>+2<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>16-17<\/td> <td>+3<\/td><\/tr> <tr> <td>18-19<\/td> <td>+4<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>20-21<\/td> <td>+5<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>22-23<\/td> <td>+6<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>24-25<\/td> <td>+7<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>26-27<\/td> <td>+8<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>28-29<\/td> <td>+9<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>30<\/td> <td>+10<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody> <\/table> <h2>4. Describe Your Character<\/h2>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it\u2019s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.<br><br>Choose your character\u2019s <strong>alignment<\/strong> (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Identify the things your character holds most dear, called <strong>bonds<\/strong>, and the <strong>flaws<\/strong> that could one day undermine him or her.<br><br>Your character\u2019s <strong>background<\/strong> describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character\u2019s place in the D&D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that\u2019s a more precise fit for your character concept.<br><br>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet. <br><br><h4>Your Character\u2019s Abilities<\/h4>Take your character\u2019s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.<br><br>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.<br><br>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.<br><br>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.<br><br>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.<br><br>A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what\u2019s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.<br><br>A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid. <br><br><h4>Building Bruenor, Step 4<\/h4>Bob fills in some of Bruenor\u2019s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.<br><br>Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line. but his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny\u2014to reclaim his homeland\u2014so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.<br><br>Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor\u2019s personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.<br><br>Given his history, Bruenor\u2019s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall. his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.<br><br>His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature\u2014he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls. leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted. <h2>5. Choose Equipment<\/h2>Your class and background determine your character\u2019s <strong>starting equipment<\/strong>, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of <strong>gold pieces<\/strong> (gp) to spend based on your class. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost.<br><br>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. <br><br><h4>Armor Class<\/h4>Your <strong>Armor Class<\/strong> (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.<br><br>Without armor or a shield, your character\u2019s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC. Record your AC on your character sheet.<br><br>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency.<br><br>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use. <br><br><h4>Weapons<\/h4>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.<br><br>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier. <ul> <li> For attacks with <strong>melee weapons<\/strong>, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.<\/li> <li> For attacks with <strong>ranged weapons<\/strong>, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.<\/li><\/ul><br><h4>Building Bruenor, Step 5<\/h4>Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.<br><br>For Bruenor\u2019s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits. <h2>6. Come Together<\/h2>Most D&D characters don\u2019t work alone. Each character plays a role within a <strong>party<\/strong>, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party\u2019s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.<br><br>",

The following entries appear among the traits of most races.<br><br><h2>Ability Score Increase</h2>Every race increases one or more of a character\u2019s ability scores.<br><br><h2>Age</h2>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race\u2019s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.<br><br><h2>Alignment</h2>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.<br><br><br><h2>Size</h2>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.

                "htmlcontent": "Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.<br><br>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you\u2019re a 5th-level character.<br><br>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you\u2019ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.<br><br><h3>Prerequisites</h3>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the\u00a0<strong>Multiclassing Prerequisites </strong>table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average Ability Scores.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Multiclassing Prerequisites</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Ability Score Minimum</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Barbarian</td>\n<td>Strength 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric</td>\n<td>Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fighter</td>\n<td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranger</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rogue</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sorcerer</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wizard</td>\n<td>Intelligence 13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h3>Experience Points</h3>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the <strong>Character Advancement </strong>table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.<br><br><h3>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.<br><br>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.<br><h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the\u00a0<strong>Character Advancement </strong>table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.<br><br><h3>Proficiencies</h3>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class\u2019s starting proficiencies, as shown in the<strong> Multiclassing Proficiencies </strong>table.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Multiclassing Proficiencies</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Proficiencies Gained</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Barbarian</td>\n<td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fighter</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk</td>\n<td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranger</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class\u2019s skill list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rogue</td>\n<td>Light armor, one skill from the class\u2019s skill list, thieves\u2019 tools</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sorcerer</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>Light armor, simple weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wizard</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h3>Class Features</h3>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don\u2019t, however, receive the class\u2019s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you\u2019re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.<br><br><h4>Channel Divinity</h4>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn\u2019t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.<br><br><h4>Extra Attack</h4>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don\u2019t add together. You can\u2019t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter\u2019s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock\u2019s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn\u2019t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.<br><br><h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can\u2019t gain it again from another class.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting</h4>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.<br><br><strong>Spells Known and Prepared</strong>: You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.<br><br>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.<br><br><strong>Spell Slots</strong>: You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the\u00a0<strong>Multiclass Spellcaster </strong>table.<br><br>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like <em>burning hands</em>, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don\u2019t have any spells of that higher level.<br><br>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don\u2019t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know\u2014and potentially enhance their effects.<br><br><strong>Pact Magic</strong>: If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Lvl.</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>",

                "htmlcontent": "Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.<br><br>This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.<br><br><h2>What Is a Spell?</h2>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect\u2014in most cases, all in the span of seconds.<br><br>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.<br><br>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse\u2019s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.<br><br><h3>Spell Level</h3>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell\u2019s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) <em>magic missile</em> at 1st level and the earth-shaking <em>wish</em> at 9th. Cantrips\u2014simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote\u2014are level 0. The higher a spell\u2019s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.<br><br>Spell level and character level don\u2019t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.<br><br><h3>Known and Prepared Spells</h3>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.<br><br>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character\u2019s level.<br><br><h3>Spell Slots</h3>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class\u2019s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.<br><br>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell\u2019s level or higher, effectively \u201cfilling\u201d a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size\u2014small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts <em>magic missile</em>, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.<br><br>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.<br><br>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.<br><br><h4>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h4>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts <em>magic missile</em> using one of her 2nd-level slots, that <em>magic missile</em> is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.<br><br><h4>Casting in Armor</h4>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.<br><br>Some spells, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>cure wounds</em>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell\u2019s description.<br><br><h3>Cantrips</h3>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster\u2019s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip\u2019s spell level is 0.<br><br><h3>Rituals</h3>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn\u2019t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can\u2019t be cast at a higher level.<br><br>To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character\u2019s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard\u2019s does.<br><br><h2>Casting a Spell</h2>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character\u2019s class or the spell\u2019s effects.<br><br>Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell\u2019s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell\u2019s effect.<br><br><h3>Casting Time</h3>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.<br><br><h4>Bonus Action</h4>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven\u2019t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can\u2019t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.<br><br><h4>Reactions</h4>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.<br><br><h4>Longer Casting Times</h4>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \u201cConcentration\u201d below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don\u2019t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.<br><br><h3>Range</h3>The target of a spell must be within the spell\u2019s range. For a spell like <em>magic missile</em>, the target is a creature. For a spell like <em>fireball</em>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.<br><br>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the <em>shield</em> spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.<br><br>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell\u2019s effect must be you (see \u201cAreas of Effect\u201d).<br><br>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren\u2019t limited by its range, unless the spell\u2019s description says otherwise.<br><br><h3>Components</h3>A spell\u2019s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell\u2019s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can\u2019t provide one or more of a spell\u2019s components, you are unable to cast the spell.<br><br><h4>Verbal (V)</h4>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren\u2019t the source of the spell\u2019s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the <em>silence</em> spell, can\u2019t cast a spell with a verbal component.<br><br><h4>Somatic (S)</h4>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.<br><br><h4>Material (M)</h4>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <strong>component pouch</strong> or a <strong>spellcasting focus</strong> (found in \u201cEquipment\u201d) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.<br><br>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.<br>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell\u2019s material components\u2014or to hold a spellcasting focus\u2014but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.<br><br><h3>Duration</h3>A spell\u2019s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.<br><h4>Instantaneous</h4>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can\u2019t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.<br><br><h4>Concentration</h4>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.<br><br>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).<br><br>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn\u2019t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:<br><br><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration</strong>. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can\u2019t concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Taking damage</strong>. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon\u2019s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Being incapacitated or killed</strong>. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n</ul>The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you\u2019re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.<br><br><h3>Targets</h3>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell\u2019s magic. A spell\u2019s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).<br><br>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature\u2019s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.<br><br><h4>A Clear Path to the Target</h4>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can\u2019t be behind total cover.<br><br>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can\u2019t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.<br><br><h4>Targeting Yourself</h4>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.<br><br><h3>Areas of Effect</h3>Spells such as <em>burning hands</em> and <em>cone of cold</em> cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.<br><br>A spell\u2019s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a <strong>point of origin</strong>, a location from which the spell\u2019s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.<br><br>A spell\u2019s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn\u2019t included in the spell\u2019s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.<br><br><h4>Cone</h4>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone\u2019s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point\u2019s distance from the point of origin. A cone\u2019s area of effect specifies its maximum length.<br>A cone\u2019s point of origin is not included in the cone\u2019s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.<br><br><h4>Cube</h4>You select a cube\u2019s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube\u2019s size is expressed as the length of each side.<br>A cube\u2019s point of origin is not included in the cube\u2019s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.<br><br><h4>Cylinder</h4>A cylinder\u2019s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell\u2019s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.<br><br>A cylinder\u2019s point of origin is included in the cylinder\u2019s area of effect.<br><br><h4>Line</h4>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.<br><br>A line\u2019s point of origin is not included in the line\u2019s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.<br><br><h4>Sphere</h4>You select a sphere\u2019s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere\u2019s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.<br><br>A sphere\u2019s point of origin is included in the sphere\u2019s area of effect.<br><br><h3>Saving Throws</h3>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell\u2019s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.<br><br>The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.<br><br><h3>Attack Rolls</h3>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.<br><br>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn\u2019t incapacitated.<br><br><h3>The Schools of Magic</h3>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.<br><br>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.<br><br><h4>Abjuration</h4>Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.<br><br><h4>Conjuration</h4>Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster\u2019s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.<br><br><h4>Divination</h4>Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.<br><br><h4>Enchantment</h4>Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.<br><br><h4>Evocation</h4>Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.<br><br><h4>Illusion</h4>Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.<br><br><h4>Necromancy</h4>Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as <em>animate dead</em> is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.<br><br><h4>Transmutation</h4>Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster\u2019s command, or enhance a creature\u2019s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.<br><br><h3>Combining Magical Effects</h3>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don\u2019t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect\u2014such as the highest bonus\u2014from those castings applies while their durations overlap.<br><br>For example, if two clerics cast <em>bless</em> on the same target, that character gains the spell\u2019s benefit only once; he or she doesn\u2019t get to roll two bonus dice.<br>",

Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a <strong>variant</strong> or <strong>template</strong>, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.<br><br><h2>Type</h2>A monster\u2019s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an <em>arrow of dragon slaying</em> deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.<br><br>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.<br><br><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature\u2019s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, and invisible stalkers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fiends </strong>are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.\u00a0Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense\u2014frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don\u2019t fit into any other type.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way.\u00a0Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the Shambling Mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</li>\n</ul><br><h3>Tags</h3>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the <em>humanoid (orc)</em> type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.<br><br><h2>Alignment</h2>A monster\u2019s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate.<br><br>The alignment specified in a monster\u2019s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster\u2019s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil Storm Giant, there\u2019s nothing stopping you.<br><br>Some creatures can have <strong>any alignment</strong>. In other words, you choose the monster\u2019s alignment. Some monster\u2019s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.<br><br>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don\u2019t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are <strong>unaligned</strong>, which means they don\u2019t have an alignment.<br><br><h2>Armor Class</h2>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster\u2019s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.<br><br><h2>Hit Points</h2>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.<br>A monster\u2019s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 \u00d7 4\u00bd).<br><br>A monster\u2019s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Table: Hit Dice by Size</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Monster Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Hit Die</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Average HP<br>\nper Die</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2\u00bd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">d6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3\u00bd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4\u00bd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5\u00bd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">d12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6\u00bd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">d20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10\u00bd</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>A monster\u2019s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).<br><br><h2>Speed</h2>A monster\u2019s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn.<br>All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster\u2019s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.<br>Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.<br><br><h3>Burrow</h3>A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can\u2019t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.<br><br><h3>Climb</h3>A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn\u2019t need to spend extra movement to climb.<br><br><h3>Fly</h3>A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to <strong>hover</strong>, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.<br><br><h3>Swim</h3>A monster that has a swimming speed doesn\u2019t need to spend extra movement to swim.<br><br><h2>Ability Scores</h2>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers.<br><br><h2>Saving Throws</h2>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn\u2019t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don\u2019t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.<br>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster\u2019s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster\u2019s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).<br><br><table>\n<caption>Table: Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Challenge Rating</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Proficiency Bonus</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1/8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1/4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1/2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">9</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">19</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">22</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">23</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">24</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">26</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">27</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">28</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">29</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">+9</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h2>Skills</h2>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.<br>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster\u2019s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster\u2019s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.<br><br><h2>Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</h2>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.<br><br><h2>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies</h2>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.<br><br>For example, a Hill Giant typically wears Hide Armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a Hill Giant with Chain Mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.<br><br><h2>Senses</h2>The Senses entry notes a monster\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.<br><br><h3>Blindsight</h3>A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.<br><br>Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.<br><br>If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.<br><br><h3>Darkvision</h3>A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.<br><br><h3>Tremorsense</h3>A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can\u2019t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.<br><br><h3>Truesight</h3>A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.<br><br><h2>Languages</h2>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can\u2019t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A \u201c\u2014\u201d indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.<br><br><h3>Telepathy</h3>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn\u2019t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages, but can\u2019t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.<br><br>A telepathic monster doesn\u2019t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can\u2019t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.<br><br>A creature within the area of an <em>antimagic field</em> or in any other location where magic doesn\u2019t function can\u2019t send or receive telepathic messages.<br><br><h2>Challenge</h2>A monster\u2019s <strong>challenge rating</strong> tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.<br><br>Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.<br>Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.<br><br><h3>Experience Points</h3>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.<br><br>Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.<br><br><table>\n<caption>Table: Experience Points by Challenge Rating</caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Challenge Rating</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">XP</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0 or 10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1/8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1/4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1/2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">700</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2,300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">9</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">7,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">13,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">19</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">22,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">33,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">22</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">41,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">23</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">24</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">62,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">75,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">26</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">90,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">27</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">105,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">28</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">120,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">29</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">135,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">155,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br><h2>Special Traits</h2>Special traits (which appear after a monster\u2019s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.<br><br><h3>Innate Spellcasting</h3>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can\u2019t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster\u2019s challenge rating.<br><br>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the <em>levitate</em> spell, but the spell has a \u201cself only\u201d restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.<br><br>A monster\u2019s innate spells can\u2019t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster\u2019s innate spells don\u2019t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.<br><br><h3>Spellcasting</h3>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher. The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.<br><br>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.<br><br>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level <em>lightning bolt</em> spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.<br><br>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.<br><br><h3>Psionics</h3>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn\u2019t require any components to cast its spells.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action.<br><br><h3>Melee and Ranged Attacks</h3>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \u201cweapon\u201d might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.<br><br><strong>Creature vs. Target</strong>: The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \u201ctarget\u201d can be a creature or an object.<br><br><strong>Hit</strong>: Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \u201c<em>Hit</em>\u201d notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.<br><br><strong>Miss</strong>: If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \u201c<em>Miss:</em>\u201d notation.<br><br><h3>Multiattack</h3>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can\u2019t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.<br><br><h3>Ammunition</h3>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.<br><br><h2>Reactions</h2>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.<br><br><h2>Limited Usage</h2>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.<br><strong>X/Day</strong>: The notation \u201cX/Day\u201d means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \u201c1/Day\u201d means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.<br><br><strong>Recharge X\u2013Y:</strong> The notation \u201cRecharge X\u2013Y\u201d means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster\u2019s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.<br><br>For example, \u201cRecharge 5\u20136\u201d means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster\u2019s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.<br><br><strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest</strong>: This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.<br><br><h2>Grapple Rules for Monsters</h2>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn\u2019t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.<br><br>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster\u2019s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster\u2019s Strength (Athletics) modifier.<br><br><h2>Equipment</h2>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.<br><br>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster\u2019s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.<br><br>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.<br><br><h2>Legendary Creatures</h2>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can\u2019t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.<br><br>If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn\u2019t gain that form\u2019s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.<br><br><h3>Legendary Actions</h3>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions\u2014called legendary actions\u2014outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature\u2019s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can\u2019t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can\u2019t use them until after its first turn in the combat.<br><br><h3>A Legendary Creature\u2019s Lair</h3>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.<br><br><h4>Lair Actions</h4>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can\u2019t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can\u2019t use one until after its first turn in the combat.<br><br><h4>Regional Effects</h4>The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.<br>",

                "htmlcontent": "<p>Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important though are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.</p><p>Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don\u2019t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a <strong>nonplayer character</strong> (NPC). </p><p>In general terms, an NPC\u2019s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It\u2019s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.<br></p><p>Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.</p><h2>Roleplaying</h2><p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case. it\u2019s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.</p><p>Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character\u2019s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p><p>There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you. </p><p><h4>Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying</h4>With this approach, you describe your character\u2019s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.</p><p>For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family\u2019s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek\u2019s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.</p><p>Chris says, \"Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.\"</p><p>In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek\u2019s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character\u2019s altitude and actions.</p><p>When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:</p><p><ul><li>Describe your character\u2019s emotions and attitude.<br></li><li>Focus on your character\u2019s intent and how others might perceive it.<br></li><li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.<br></li></ul></p><p>Don\u2019t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.</p><h4>Active Approach to Roleplaying</h4><p>If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.</p><p>When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character\u2019s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character\u2019s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can\u2019t be reasonably acted out.</p><p>Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here\u2019s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:</p><p>Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I\u2019d snap your arm and enjoy your screams.\" In his normal voice, Chris then adds, \"I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.\"</p><h4>Results of Roleplaying</h4><p>The DM uses your character\u2019s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p><p>When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM\u2019s portrayal of the NPC\u2019s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC\u2019s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC\u2019s attitude.</p><p>Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble\u2019s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.</p><h2>Ability Checks</h2><p>In addition to roleptaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.</p><p>Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC\u2019s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC\u2019s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM\u2019s discretion.</p><p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage\u2019s release, the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.<br></p>",

                "parentlist": "unearthedarcana",
                "htmlcontent": "In a typical campaign, it's possible for the characters to start at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of time. While that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign with pauses built into it—times when adventurers do things other than go on adventures. By introducing downtime activities that take weeks, months, or even years of effort, you can give your campaign a longer timeline that allows events in the world to play out over the course of years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of an entire lifetime of adventure. The downtime rules also provide ways for characters to spend the monetary treasure they amass on their adventures. The options given here can be used as alternatives to the downtime options in the Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide, or you can use the material here to inspire your creation of new options.<br><h2>Overview</h2>The downtime system here is built on two basic elements. First, it offers short-term activities, ones that can usually be completed in a workweek (5 days) or longer. These activities cover what characters at levels 1–10 might do between adventures. It includes buying or creating magic items, pulling off heists, and working a job. Higher level characters can also use these activities, but they have the resources and power to take on greater ambitions beyond the scope of these rules. Second, this downtime system introduces the concept of foils. Foils are NPCs who oppose the characters or whose goals put them against the party. A foil might be a villain who wishes to destroy the characters, or a good-aligned cleric who sees the characters as meddlers and troublemakers. Foils work their plots while the characters engage in downtime activities, introducing interesting complications to the campaign.<h2>The Basics</h2>The downtime system allows characters to pursue long-term activities between game sessions. A character selects a downtime activity and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.<h4>Choosing an Activity</h4> As DM, you should present the players with a list of activities they can pursue. These activities work for characters of any level. The activities you allow depend on your campaign and the nature of the area where the characters are. For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items, or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items. You decide which activities are available, not the players. Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their activities at the end of a session, by email or text, or when you next see them in person. <h4>Resolving Activities</h4> Each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many require a check, so be sure to note the character’s bonuses as needed. Follow the steps in the activity and determine the results. Most activities require a workweek (5 days) or more to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days apiece), or months (30 days apiece). A character must spend 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity’s completion. The days don’t need to be consecutive. If you want multiple weeks to pass in the campaign world between sessions, report back the results of any downtime activities and ask for each character’s next moves. Otherwise, you can send out the results to each player by text or email, or catch the players up at the start of the next session. If an activity requires some decisions, you can have the players decide either before the next session or at the start of it. Some DMs like to focus on the activity, but for some groups it’s a good idea to let the players talk things out, so long as it doesn’t drag out and eat up too much time at the game table. <h4>Complications</h4> Each activity includes complications you can throw at the characters. Complications are meant to add flavor, depth, and drama to the campaign. They might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs who vex the party, and give the characters headaches as they try to navigate the politics and social network of the community they’re in. In general, there is a 10 percent chance that a given activity has a complication. You can use them more or less often, depending on what you feel is best for your campaign. Complications can also come from the party’s foils, as described below. In the complication table for an activity, the options that are most likely to involve a foil are marked.<h2>Foils</h2> Foils are NPCs who actively oppose the characters. They might be villains you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. They can also include good or neutral folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they are rivals, they have opposing goals, or they simply dislike one another. The cultist of Orcus, whose plans the characters have foiled; the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the city with an iron fist; and the nosy high priest of Helm who is convinced the characters are up to no good are all examples of foils. A foil is an NPC with an agenda that changes over time. As the characters take downtime between adventures, their foils rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters. <h4>Creating a Foil</h4> The first step in creating a foil is building an NPC or picking one from your current cast of characters. It’s a good idea to have two or three foils at a time, each with an agenda. At least one should be a villain, and the others might be neutral or good. Their conflict with the characters might be social or political, rather than include direct attacks. The best foils are personal. Find links in the characters’ backstories or recent adventures that provide a good explanation for what sparked the foil’s actions. The best trouble for the characters is trouble they created for themselves. <table> <caption>Example Foils</caption> <thead> <tr><th>d20</th><th>Foil</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>1</td><td>Tax collector who is convinced the characters are dodging fees</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Politican who is concerned that the characters are causing more trouble than they solve</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>High priest who worries the characters are diminishing the temple’s prestige</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>Wizard who blames the characters for some recent troubles</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>Rival adventuring party</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>Bard who loves a scandal enough to spark one</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>Childhood rival or member of a rival clan</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>Scorned sibling or parent</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>Merchant who blames the characters for any business woes</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>Newcomer out to make a mark on the world</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>Sibling or ally of defeated enemy</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>Official seeking to restore a tarnished reputation</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>Deadly foe disguised as a social rival</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>Fiend seeking to tempt the characters to evil</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>Spurned romantic interest</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>Political opportunist seeking a scapegoat</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>Traitorous noble looking to foment a revolution</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>Would-be tyrant who brooks no opposition</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>Exiled noble looking for revenge</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>Corrupt official paranoid that crimes will be revealed</td></tr> </tbody></table><h4>Motivation</h4>An effective foil has a clear reason for interfering with the characters’ plans. Think about what the foil wants, how and why the characters stand in the way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Motivation is the why behind a foil’s actions. It’s the foundation for the NPC’s role in the campaign. The Example Foils table offers some examples you can build from.<h4>Goals</h4>Once you know a foil’s motivation, consider possible goals. What outcome is the foil trying to create? Ideally, this outcome involves the characters or something they care about. The foil might want to take over the town, slay one or all of the characters, or help a certain temple become the center of the most powerful religion in the region.<h4>Assets</h4>Think about the resources that the foil can call upon. Is there money for bribes? Is there a small army of obedient fanatics? Does the foil hold sway over any guilds, temples, or groups? Make a list of the foil’s assets, and consider how they can be used.<h4>Actions</h4>With the what and why covered, the meat of a foil’s presence in the campaign comes down to actions. Make a list of three or four actions the foil might take. Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the actions the foil might take and introduce it into play. An action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session, or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a foil who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren’t involved, the event becomes the talk of the town. Actions should build a path toward achieving the NPC’s goals. For each action, make note of NPCs who might change in response to it, what it might change in the town’s politics, and so on. Of course, if the characters get involved, those outcomes might change. The concept behind actions is simple. They show the characters that the campaign is a living world by making the foils participants in the campaign’s action. The examples of complications given for downtime activities are ideal plans for a foil to make against the characters. Use them as inspiration for plans of your own creation, or throw them, as written, at the characters when it seems appropriate. You can use a complication in place of a foil’s actions, or in addition to one. Not every bad thing that happens to the characters is caused by a foil. Some events might just be due to bad luck.<h4>Events</h4>In addition to actions, consider how the campaign setting might shift due to the foil’s influence. What are the background events, changes in attitudes, and anything else that might occur to illustrate a foil’s influence? Imagine if the characters do nothing to oppose a foil. What happens next? How does the world change? Introduce such events along with the foil’s actions to make your campaign feel alive. You can use an event in place of an action, especially if a session isn’t going to involve a foil. Events are also a good way to show the influence of multiple foils, without having all of them take action against the characters at once. Events let foils have their time in the spotlight without causing the other ones to fade away completely.<h4>Revise</h4>Remember that foils are characters who can change over time. If the characters thwart one plan, a foil might pursue another. A foil might also become an ally, or achieve all goals and thus become inactive. Between sessions, revise your foils as needed to account for how things have progressed in the campaign.<br><h3>Example Foil: Myron Rodemus</h3>The Rodemus clan was once a small but powerful family of traders, but thirty years ago, they pulled up stakes and left town overnight. Now, Myron Rodemus, the family’s youngest son, has returned to the city to reclaim his family’s place of prestige. In truth, the Rodemuses fled because they had contracted lycanthropy. Absorbed into a clan of wererats, they liquidated their assets and delved into smuggling in a distant city out of fear that their secret would be impossible to maintain in their home city. Myron fought his way to the topmost ranks of the wererat clans and, along with a small army of followers, has returned to claim his rightful place among the city’s elite. If he doesn’t succeed, he’s vowed leave the city in ruins. <p><p><strong>Goals.</strong> Myron wants to become the most respected, most important merchant in town, someone to whom even the prince must yield.</p></p><p><p><strong>Assets.</strong> He has a small fortune in gold; his own skills as a wererat, alchemist, and necromancer; a group of wererats that is dedicated to him; the service of twin dwarf sisters who are superb assassins; a shield guardian that protects him; and an alliance with a hobgoblin lord, who lives in the mountains outside of the city.</p></p><p><p><strong>Actions.</strong> Myron works to discredit and ruin other merchants. His wererats spy on his rivals and feed information to the hobgoblins, leading them to raid caravans. The wererats sneak into warehouses, unleashing hordes of rats to spoil goods. Myron even throws a few of his own caravans and warehouses away to throw off suspicion. If Myron’s plans fail, he has a terrible alternative. His knowledge of alchemy has allowed him to breed a deadly plague that he will unleash on the city via hordes of rats. If he can’t rule, then no one will.</p></p> <table> <caption>Myron's Plans</caption> <thead> <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Event</td><td>Rats become a noticeable problem in the streets, with swarms sighted in rundown neighborhoods. Folk demand action be taken.</td></tr> <tr><td>Action</td><td>Caravan raids become more common, and folk talk of gathering a small army to drive the goblinoids away.

The high priest, Cheldar, wishes to bring as many folk as possible under the temple’s sway. Though only in town for two years, the temple is already a powerful force due to Cheldar’s brilliant oration.<p><p><strong>Goals.</strong> Cheldar wants to make the temple of Pholtus the most influential religion in town by bringing about peace and stability for all. He believes keeping adventurers in check or driving them out of town is an important step in that plan.</p></p><p><p><strong>Assets.</strong> The high priest Cheldar has his charismatic oration, divine spellcasting ability, and a few hundred common folk recently converted to the temple’s cause.</p></p><p><p><strong>Actions.</strong> Cheldar is stern, but fundamentally a good person. He seeks to win support by providing charity, promoting peace, and working to enforce law and order. However, he is skeptical of the characters, convinced that adventurers are troublemakers who will ruin the peace. He wants only officials of the town or the temple to be involved in handling any crises that arise. He genuinely believes in his goals, but can be made an ally by sufficiently good-hearted characters.</p></p><table> <caption>Cheldar's Plans</caption> <thead> <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Event</td><td>The grand festival of Pholtus sees the streets filled with somber worshipers who maintain a 24-hour torchlit vigil during the winter solstice. They offer food, drink, and shelter to all in the temple of Pholtus.</td></tr> <tr><td>Action</td><td>Cheldar appears in a tavern frequented by adventurers, along with a small group of followers, seeking converts. A few NPC adventurers join his cause.</td></tr> <tr><td>Action</td><td>Cheldar rails against forces of chaos in a public address in the town square, laying blame for recent troubles on adventurers meddling in things best left alone.</td></tr> <tr><td>Event</td><td>The characters find that adventurers in town receive an, at best, icy reception, as the mood turns against them.</td></tr> <tr><td>Action</td><td>Cheldar demands that the city levy enormous taxes on adventurers, claiming that they must pay their fair share to keep the city safe. After all, such wanderers can simply leave if their actions bring the city trouble. The common folk don’t have that option.</td></tr> </tbody></table><h2>Sample Downtime Activities</h2>The following activities are available for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have final say on which activities are available to the characters.<h3>Buying a Magic Item</h3>Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee they will have the desired items.<h4>Resources</h4>Finding magic items to purchase requires one workweek of effort and 100 gp minimum in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item.<h4>Resolution</h4>A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine the quality of seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus for every workweek beyond the first spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every 100 gp spent on the search. The total bonus for time and money spent can’t be greater than +10. As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master’s Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item—such as a potion or a scroll—when using the table to determine an asking price. You have final say in determining which items are for sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say. If the characters seek a specific magic item, first decide if it’s an item you want to allow in the game.

Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</p><h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2><p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p><p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character\u2019s career.</p><p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p> <table> <caption>Lifestyle Expenses</caption> <thead><tr><th>Lifestyle</th><th>Price/Day</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Wretched</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>Squalid</td><td>1 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Poor</td><td>2 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Modest</td><td>1 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>2 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>4 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>10 gp minimum</td></tr> </tbody></table><p><strong>Wretched</strong>. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns. huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p><p><strong>Squalid</strong>. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p><p><strong>Poor</strong>. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types. </p><p><strong>Modest</strong>. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don\u2019t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><strong>Comfortable</strong>. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p><p><strong>Wealthy</strong>. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic</strong>. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><h2>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h2><p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night\u2019s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.</p><table> <caption>Food, Drink, and Lodging</caption> <thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead> <thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Ale</td></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Gallon</td><td>2 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Mug</td><td>4 cp</td></tr> </tbody> <tbody> <tr><td>Banquet (per person)</td><td>10 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Bread, loaf</td><td>2 cp</td></tr> <tr><td>Cheese, hunk</td><td>1 sp</td></tr> </tbody> <thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Inn stay (per day)</td></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Squalid</td><td>7 cp</td></tr> <tr><td>Poor</td><td>1 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Modest</td><td>5 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>8 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>2 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>4 gp</td></tr> </tbody> <thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Meals (per day)</td></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Squalid</td><td>3 cp</td></tr> <tr><td>Poor</td><td>6 cp</td></tr> <tr><td>Modest</td><td>3 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>5 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>8 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>2 gp</td></tr> </tbody> <tbody> <tr><td>Meat, chunk</td><td>3 sp</td></tr> <tr><td> </td><td> </td></tr> </tbody> <thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Wine</td></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Common (pitcher)</td><td>2 sp</td></tr> <tr><td>Fine (bottle)</td><td>10 gp</td></tr> </tbody>  </table><h2>Services</h2><p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund\u2019s secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><table> <caption>Services</caption> <thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Pay</th></tr></thead> <thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Coach cab</td></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Between towns</td><td>3 cp per mile</td></tr> <tr><td>Within a city</td><td>1 cp</td></tr> </tbody> <thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Hireling</td></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Skilled</td><td>2 gp per day</td></tr> <tr><td>Untrained</td><td>2 sp per day</td></tr> </tbody> <tbody> <tr><td>Messenger</td><td>2 cp per mile</td></tr> <tr><td>Road or gate toll</td><td>1 cp</td></tr> <tr><td>Ship\u2019s passage</td><td>1 sp per mile</td></tr> </tbody></table><h2>Spellcasting Services</h2><p>People who are able to cast spells don\u2019t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>",
