Highly experimental, please do screw around with it, and see what's lacking. Things I know to be shit:  \n- Doesn't respect enchanted armor  \n- Can give people armor with greater Strength requirements than they can wield  \n- Completely untested vs Homebrew  \n- Doesn't scale spellcasters brilliantly (although I reckon it's passable; feedback appreciated).  Besides these known issues, it's generally never going to be perfect, so don't expect it to ever be. We're aiming for \"functionally good enough,\" here.\n- Added optional \"Close Tab?\" confirmation to DM Screen (option is in the sidebar)\n- Fixed various issues with Bestiary Proficiency Dice toggler\n- Minor Statblock Converter improvements\n- Added Blessed of Corellon variant rule\n- Fixed Bestiary list sorting; now prefers Name -> Source as a fallback (or Source -> Name if sorted by Source)\n- Scrolling lists with J/K now keeps the selected item in view\n- Made \"Recharge X-Y\" click/rollable\n- Fixed missing vulnerabilities on Objects\n- Randomising a subclass can no longer randomise the already-selected subclass\n- Added /clear command to Dice Roller\n- Fixed various issues with local homebrew loading\n- Exporting a filter link now includes only the non-defaulted filters, so the links are much smaller\n- Added f and SHIFT-f as hotkeys to place the cursor in search boxes; list search and omnisearch respectively\n- Added \"Previous\"/\"Next\"/\"Back to Top\" buttons to bottom of book pages\n- Classes page now filters homebrew sources as own distinct type\n- Dice Roller placeholder text now contains \"drop lowest/highest\" examples\n- Bestiary print view defaults to printing the current creature if none are sublisted\n- Fixed Items page sublist sorting in browsers using, as a decimal separator\n- Added @diety tag\n- (Fixed typos/minor content holes/etc)"
